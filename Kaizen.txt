also take this input, You are defining the MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP) for a local-first cooking &
grocery management application.
This prompt strictly depends on:
- PROMPT-1: Application System Contract
- PROMPT-2: Application Data Model
- PROMPT-3: Domain Logic Engines
- PROMPT-4: Local Storage Mapping
- PROMPT-5: Sync & Import Strategy
- PROMPT-6: Workflow Actions
- PROMPT-7: UI Composition Rules
- PROMPT-8: Edge-case Validation & Test Scenarios
You MUST NOT violate any of them.
❗ DO NOT redesign logic
❗ DO NOT add features
❗ DO NOT optimize prematurely
❗ DO NOT assume multiple users
❗ DO NOT assume cloud infrastructure
Your task is to CUT the system down to the SMALLEST set of features
that still proves the system works end-to-end.

## MVP PHILOSOPHY (LOCKED)
- MVP must be usable daily
- MVP must exercise ALL core logic engines
- MVP must support at least one complete cooking cycle:
  Plan → Check availability → Buy → Cook → Update stock
- MVP must be buildable quickly
- Anything not required for daily use is OUT
---
## REQUIRED MVP CAPABILITIES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The MVP MUST include:
### Core Data
- Ingredients
- Final Dishes
- Intermediates (if required by dishes)
- Basic Shop & Price data (minimal)
### Core Logic Engines
- Availability Engine
- Quantity Aggregation Engine
- Priority Propagation Engine
- Spoilage & Expiry Engine
### Core Workflow Actions
- Buy Ingredient
- Prepare Intermediate
- Cook Final Dish
### Core UI Surfaces
- Ingredients Surface
- Dishes Surface
- Shopping List Surface
(Local-first, offline-capable)
---
## EXPLICITLY INCLUDED (MVP YES)
Mark these as INCLUDED:
- Local storage (single chosen backend)
- Manual data entry
- CSV import/export (basic)
- Stock quantity tracking
- Expiry detection
- Priority propagation
- Shopping list auto-generation
- Blocking invalid actions (cook when unavailable)
---
## EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (MVP NO)
Mark these as OUT OF SCOPE for MVP:
- Real-time sync
- Multi-device sync
- User accounts
- Collaboration
- Notifications / reminders
- Route optimization
- Advanced analytics
- Visual dashboards
- Historical reports
- Undo / redo (optional later)
- Price history charts
- Recipe scaling UI
---
## MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA (TESTABLE)
Define success as:
- A user can plan multiple dishes
- The app correctly computes:
  - Availability
  - Required quantities
  - Shopping list
- Buying ingredients updates stock correctly
- Cooking a dish updates stock correctly
- Expiry status updates automatically
- No stock corruption occurs after restart
- App works fully offline
---
## OUTPUT CONSTRAINT
Respond ONLY with:
1. A concise list of INCLUDED MVP features
2. A concise list of EXCLUDED features
3. A 5–7 step MVP user journey (end-to-end)
4. Clear justification for each exclusion
DO NOT:
- Suggest future features
- Propose timelines
- Recommend tools
- Add UI polish ideas
Wait for the next instruction.
